# BirdsNest

BirdsNest is designed to help visually explore and make sense the connections between systems and objects within your environment. 

Data is ingested into the BirdsNest neo4j database by system-specific scanners that can read the system and it's direct connections. A systems 'nodes' are connected into the wider mesh of data from everything else in your environment. 

The BirdsNest console then allows you to query and view all the interconnected data, finding pathways to data that are not obvious or easily discovered. You can either start from a single node and discover interconnections as you go, or search for a specific type of path through your data.
