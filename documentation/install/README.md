# BirdsNest Installation

BirdsNest customers will receive the [Managed Installer](/documentation/install/managed.md), which should handle the installation from end to end.

For those doing a manual install, start with the [Manual Install Quick Start Guide](/documentation/install/manual-quickstart.md) if doing a standard install on Windows Server 2016+ authenticating against Active Directory.

See the [Complete Installation Documentation](/documentation/install/completeinstall.md) for detailed installation information.
