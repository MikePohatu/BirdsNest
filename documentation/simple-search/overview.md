# Overview

Simple search consists of a single text box into which a user can enter search terms. Additional fields or conditional logic are not available (these require [Advanced Search](/documentation/advanced-search/overview.md "Advanced Search")). 

Searches only query the name field within the database, i.e. the node names that appear in the visualizer.
